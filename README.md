# ENEL290 Colour Sensor

# Assignment Brief
Please design, build and characterise a sensor to illustrate one or more concepts that you
are learning about in ENEL290. Your sensor should detect a physical property (any of
current, voltage, resistance, conductance, impedance, reactance, luminous intensity,
sound intensity, pressure, humidity, or some other physical property) and should produce
a proportionate signal using another physical quantity. You can use any of the
components available in the Electronics Store. Your sensor should rely on a combination
of components from the Store to produce a unique combination of input and output
physical properties.

Once you have built and characterised your sensor, produce a datasheet describing its
behaviour. Your datasheet should be between one and two pages long. You can use the
briefing notes included here as a template.
In addition to your datasheet, include a commentary (up to one page in length)
describing how you gathered the data in your datasheet and explaining how you decided
which data to include (and/or exclude) in your datasheet.

# What We actually decided
The sensor made was a colour sensor made from an LDR next to a flashing RGB LED, outputting the colour detected as the same colour as that detected. This interfaced with an Arduino Uno and would likely work with most other microcontroller.
